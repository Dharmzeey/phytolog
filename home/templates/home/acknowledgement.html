    All praises and adoration to Allah, the one, the king, the mighty and the most powerful.
    Tonnes and unquantifiable appreciation to my parents and sibling for the opportunity and countless supports. And also to my uncle who always encourage and inspire me, and also to my senior turn sister who keeps telling me about reality of life.

    I also acknowledge the work my Lecturers in the department of Forest production and Products which was used during the course of this project. The article <b> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258257178_Tree_species_Diversity_in_the_Department_of_Forest_Resources_Management_University_of_Ibadan_Nigeria " target="_blank">
    TREE SPECIES DIVERSITY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREST RESOURCE MANAGMENT, UNIVERSITY OF IBADAN, NIGERIA</a> </b> came in handy with getting the names of some trees and most importantly local names of some species.

    Another delightfulness to <b> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/"> THE IUCN RED LIST OF THREATENED SPECIES</a> </b> Their documentation really helped in the conservation status of many trees.
